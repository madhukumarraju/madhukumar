Datahiding 
Datahiding is a process of hiding internal data.We cant acces the internal ddata directly.Afte validation outside person can access the data.
By declaring datamembers as a private we can access the data hiding
ex:
public class bank
{
private double bal;
public double get bal()
{
//validation
return balance;
}]
};
