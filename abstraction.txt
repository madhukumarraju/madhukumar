Abstraction
Abstraction is a process of hiding the data and show the only essential data only.
Abstraction can be achieved by using abstract class and interfaces.
without effecting we can able to perform thechanges n the internal implementstion.
                                      Encaplusation
 1)wrapping the data and the code into a single unit is known as the encapluszton.
to achieve encaplusation we can provide all datamembers as a private and we provide public methods to access that private datamembers/
public methods whic are used to read the data members ids known as getter method.
public method whic are used to accesss or update the private datamembers is known as the setter method.
                                     overloading
*creating multiple methods in a class with same name with different arguments
*argument should be different with type or length.
* we dont want to remember all method nameswhich are doing the same function
* we cant overload by return type.


yes we can overload the two static method which have different parameters.
